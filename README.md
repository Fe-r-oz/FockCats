# Perceval Processor Generator

## Introduction
This script provides a method called `get_CCZ` that returns a Perceval Processor for quantum computing simulations.

## Usage
1. Install the required dependencies by running:

2. Import the `get_CCZ` method in your Python script or interactive environment.

3. Call the `get_CCZ` method to obtain a Perceval Processor.

4. Optionally, execute the generated processor for quantum computing simulations.

## Result
The script generates a Perceval Processor with specific configurations for quantum computing simulations. It includes a predefined truth table, state definitions, and an algorithm analyzer.

## Explanation
The provided code in `main.py` initializes a Perceval Processor with a specific quantum circuit configuration. The states and truth table are defined for the quantum algorithm analyzer. The script computes the results based on the truth table and displays the performance and fidelity of the quantum simulation.
